excel bank reconciliation template


An excel bank reconciliation template is an essential tool for any business or individual seeking to maintain precise financial records. The primary goal of a bank reconciliation is to compare the cash balance on a company’s balance sheet to the corresponding amount on its bank statement, identifying any differences between the two records. Utilizing a pre-formatted spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel streamlines this critical accounting task, ensuring financial accuracy and providing a clear audit trail. A well-designed template helps detect errors, identify fraudulent transactions, and manage cash flow more effectively, making it a cornerstone of sound bookkeeping practices.



A comprehensive excel bank reconciliation template should include several key components to simplify the process. A robust template will typically feature dedicated sections for both the bank balance and the book balance, allowing for a side-by-side comparison. Key elements to look for in an effective template include:




A summary section that clearly displays the starting balances, total additions, total subtractions, and the final adjusted balances for both the bank and the company records.


A detailed area to list and track reconciling items, such as outstanding checks (checks written by the company but not yet cleared by the bank).


A section for deposits in transit (cash and checks received and recorded by the company but not yet recorded on the bank statement).


Fields for bank service charges, interest earned, and other adjustments that may appear on the bank statement but have not yet been recorded in the company’s cash book.





The bank reconciliation process becomes methodical and efficient when using a template. The typical workflow involves a few straightforward steps. First, you gather your company’s cash book records and the relevant bank statement for the period. Then, you proceed with the reconciliation by following these stages:




Enter the ending balance from the bank statement and the ending balance from your company’s cash account into the designated fields in the template.


Compare the deposits listed on the bank statement with the deposits in your cash book, identifying any deposits in transit.


Compare the cleared checks and withdrawals on the bank statement with the entries in your cash book to identify any outstanding checks.


Account for any bank fees, service charges, or interest earned by adjusting your cash book balance accordingly.


Once all adjustments are made, the adjusted bank balance should match the adjusted book balance, confirming that your records are reconciled.
